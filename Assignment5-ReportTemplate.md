# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Each team member ran the software and performed the analyses on their own, then the whole team came together to discuss the results and create the report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some of the softwares can be difficult to use and interpet. Each of the team members initially struggled understanding how the dataset needed to be modified to work with the programs. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

It might make the lab easier to interpet if the data is provided in the txt format used by most of the programs rather than just the excel format.
